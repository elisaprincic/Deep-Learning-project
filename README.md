# Foundations of deep learning - Project
The project was carried out during the course of Deep Learning, Master degree in Data science. 
We designed CNN-, LSTM- and Conv1D-based architectures to classify pedestrian and cyclist micro-doppler radar signals. We implemented dimensionality reduction, data augmentation, and achieved 86% accuracy on test set.
